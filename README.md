# Shortest_substring-that-contain_each_string_as_substring

# Question 

Given a list of strings where no string is a substring of another, find the shortest string that
contains each string in the list as a substring. The problem needs to be solved using Greedy
with O(n^3) complexity. Write down the greedy assumption as comments in the program and
provide whether the greedy solution will achieve optimal solution or not.


Input: [CATGC, CTAAGT, GCTA, TTCA, ATGCATC]

Output: The shortest superstring is GCTAAGTTCATGCAT
